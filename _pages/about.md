About me
======
I am a 5th year PhD Candidate at NYU's Biology Deparment supervised by [Richard Bonneau](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/richard-bonneau). My research focuses on interpretable deep learning and biophysical modeling for network inference, specifically for transcriptional regulation. During my Ph.D., I interned at Genetech in their Research and Development (gRED) department. I have a B.S. in Physics, Astronomy-Physics and French from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

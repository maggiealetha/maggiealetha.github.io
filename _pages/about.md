About me
======
I earned my PhD from NYU's Biology Deparment supervised by [Richard Bonneau](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/richard-bonneau) August 2025. My research focuses on interpretable deep learning and biophysical modeling for network inference, specifically for transcriptional regulation. During my Ph.D., I interned at [Genetech](https://www.gene.com/) in their Research and Development (gRED) department. Before my PhD I studied netowrk inference in complex systems at the [Wisconsin Center for Sleep and Consciousness](https://centerforsleepandconsciousness.psychiatry.wisc.edu/), and developed algorithms for [signal processing](https://www.nevis.columbia.edu/reu/2017/) [astroparticle-physics experiments](https://wipac.wisc.edu/) at the South Pole. I have a B.S. in Physics, Astronomy-Physics and French from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
